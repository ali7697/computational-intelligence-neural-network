# computational-intelligence-neural-network
I have implemented two classifiers for classifying the data in the given dataset. One of the classifiers is linear, and one is non-linear. The non-linear one is a neural network that I have implemented from scratch. In the end, I have compared the result achieved using each of these classifiers.
